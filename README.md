# group7-unitygame

Educational game.

Ideas:
1) Showing the magnetic fields? (but what's the user going to do with this interaction)
2) Showing periodic table (with visualization of electrons)
3) Visualgo kind of sorting visualization

Using Unity 2018.3.8f1

Roles: (Pick one) [Remember to add ideas and what is added for each roles]
1) Develop an interactive periodic table that each element is clickable (with the VR controller) (Dylan)
  - Highlight on the elements when it is raycasted(pointed)
  - Background (Think we should have it in a room, so users wont have the impression that you can roam around freely like in the open world)
  
2) UI of the popups after clicking on an element(Stephen)
  - The number of proton, neutron
  - The symbol
  - The full name
  - The sp hybridization
3) Visualization of the atom (Wei Wen)
  - 2 Forms, atom form and sorted form(Electron, proton and neutron is seperated)
  - Atom form
    - Electron will orbit around the nuclears(Center point)
    - The Nucleus will spin to show the other Protons/Neutrons (Will change depending on feedback)
4) Research on all of the elements on the periodic table (Ian)
  - Numbers of electron, protons & neutrons (Idea)
  - Details of each element (Idea)
When you are done with your stuffs, help the others, some might be easier to finish than the others.
